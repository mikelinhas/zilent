Zilent App
=============

Silent auction APP for the Kapita Foundation. Hope it works! ^^

Built with Node + Express + Vue! :)

Database will be run through mLab.

[Note] I'm deploying it in HEROKU, therefore the "npm start" script has to be changed from "nodejs server" to "node server", for some reason.

[SASS] 
sass --watch client/css/sass:client/css

[COPY] 
cp ~/apps/zilent-vue/dist/* ~/apps/zilent/client/js/
