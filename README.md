Hendricks App 
=============

Building a server to run all the lovely Python stuff from Endika.

Built with Node + Express + Vue! :)

Im guessing the database will be controlled by the python master. 
[UPDATE] Wrong, I will start its own MySQL database on HEROKU just to give Endika something to see.

[Note] I'm deploying it in HEROKU, therefore the "npm start" script has to be changed from "nodejs server" to "node server", for some reason.
